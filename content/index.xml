      <description>So, Who Am I? 
Iâ€™m just another teenager who likes writing, programming and making stuff. Even setting the title as Who Am I for this article is reminding me of whoami in Linux. I feel the inner urge to contribute something to the Internet because I love writing and I believe posting something online enables users all around the globe to see your work and suggest improvements.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve also started taking interest in web designing and hosting the fruitful results of which these site and blogs are!</description>
